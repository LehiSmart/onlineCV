			<h2>Experience</h2>

			<h5>2024</h5>
			<h4>Software Engineering Intern, Switzerland</h4>

			<p>
			After spending a year in Switzerland to develop my skills

			of languages.

			Working in a busy hotel environment both in the front of house 
			and the kitchens, I have learned the valuable skills of managing my time 
			efficiently to get tasks done. I can estimate how long a task will be 
			and due to the nature of this job I gained a lot of confidence in 
			dealing with people – allowing me to lease with other departments and 
			ask the right questions.
			</p>
	
			<h6>2019</h6>
			<h4>Warehouse Operative, Amazon</h4>
			<p>
			I worked in the Amazon warehouse as a picker. 
			Retrieving packages from the warehouse onto other 
			processes such as packing. I learnt an awful lot 
			about how large companies utilize labour to achieve 
			such high quotas. This job gave me the confidence 
			I needed to work well in what would otherwise be 
			considered a tasking role.

			<h6>2016</h6>
			<h4>Product Designer, TATA Steel</h4>
			<p>

			building 3d models on software called Steelworks.

			to execute a task well.
