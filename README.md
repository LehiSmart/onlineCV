## How It's Made:

**Tools used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python

Utilising my own experience building small sites through the years as well as knowledge obtained through university or my own research i have managed to build a great site to build from. The site is as modular as i can make it and it will go through several iterations as time goes on. I've always enjoyed playing around with web development due to its ease and fun.
